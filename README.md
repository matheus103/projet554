# INF554 - Data Challenge

The project falls in several parts related to the different methods apply. Basic knowledge required to run and understand the code is described.
> ChatPotte.py contains most of the functions and wrappers used to fetch data, to prepocess it, put the text in readable form, evaluate it on test and eval test.
> Load.py imports the whole content of ChatPotte, and add the code lines to import data into variables used in other Python programs.
> w2v-like files are dedicated to a peculiar type of word embedding. It's mainly used in for BERT and GloVe methods using transfer learning based on text.
> Each other file is caracteristic of an algorithm to answer our problem.
